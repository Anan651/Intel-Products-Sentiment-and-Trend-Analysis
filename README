# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This project evaluates sentiment on a dataset using a pre-trained BERT model (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`).

## Features
- Sentiment analysis using BERT.
- Supports evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Visualizes results with a confusion matrix.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- CUDA support (optional for GPU acceleration)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the required models:
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your dataset in the same folder as `app.py`. Ensure it has the following structure:

    | title          | content                       | rating |
    |----------------|-------------------------------|--------|
    | Great movie!   | I loved it!                   | 2      |
    | Not great      | It was boring and predictable | 0      |

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python app.py --data_path <path_to_csv>
    ```

3. View metrics and confusion matrix.

## Output
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix visualization.
